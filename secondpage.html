In tropical climates there are often only two seasons: a wet season and a dry season. Tropical climates are frost-free and changes in the solar angle are small.

								<p>Libya is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa, bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, Egypt to the east, Sudan to the southeast, Chad and Niger to the south and Algeria and Tunisia to the west.The tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forest biome, also known as tropical dry forest, monsoon forest, vine thicket, vine scrub and dry rainforest is located at tropical and subtropical latitudes. Though these forests occur in climates that are warm year-round, and may receive several hundred centimeters of rain per year, they have long dry seasons which last several months and vary with geographic location. These seasonal droughts have great impact on all living things in the forest.

									Deciduous trees predominate in most of these forests, and during the drought a leafless period occurs, which varies with species type. Because trees lose moisture through their leaves, the shedding of leaves allows trees such as teak and mountain ebony to conserve water during dry periods. The newly bare trees open up the canopy layer, enabling sunlight to reach ground level and facilitate the growth of thick underbrush.</p>

A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.

										High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level.A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak.

										<p>Antarctica, on average, is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent, and has the highest average elevation of all the continents.Antarctica is a desert, with annual precipitation of only 200 mm (8 in) along the coast and far less inland.A humid subtropical climate is a zone of climate characterised by hot and humid summers where tropical air masses dominate, and mild winters. These climates normally lie on the southeast side of all continents, generally between latitudes 25° and 35° and are adjacent to tropical climates to the south. While many subtropical climates tend to be located at coastal or near coastal locations, in some cases they extend inland, most notably in China and the United States.

											Under the Köppen climate classification, Cfa and Cwa climates are either described as humid subtropical climates or mild temperate climates. This climate features mean temperatures in the coldest month between 0 °C (32 °F) and 18 °C (64 °F) and mean temperatures in the warmest month 22 °C (72 °F) or higher. However, while some climatologists have opted to describe this climate type as a "humid subtropical climate",</p>
